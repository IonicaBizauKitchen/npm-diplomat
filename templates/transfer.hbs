Hi {{owner}} (and {{requester}}),

I hope that you are well, and that you only missed {{requester}}'s previous
email because your life is too full of wonderful distractions to be bothered
dealing with this issue.

{{requester}} (https://npmjs.com/~{{requester}}) is eager to take over https://www.npmjs.com/package/{{pkg}},
and plans to actively develop it. Given that the project appears to be
unmaintained, we would like to hand it off to {{requester}}.

If you're comfortable with this, you can add {{requester}} to the project
yourself by running the following command in your shell:

npm owner add {{requester}} {{pkg}}

If this causes you any stress or inconvenience, please let us know as soon
as possible. If we don't hear back from you within a week, we will add
{{requester}} as a package owner.

Thanks,
{{agent}}
